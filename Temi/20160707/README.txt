	dp_socket_jul16_ita.pdf				---> the text of the exam (Italian version)
	test.sh							---> the script you need to launch to test your solution
	makezip.sh						---> this script will produce the FINAL zip file with your solution. Leave it where it is generated by the script!!!
	README.txt						---> this file

To launch the test please use the following command:
./test.sh
The script will compile your solutions (with the commands described in the exam text) and will run the tests.

To create the final .zip file containing your solution, please use the makezip.sh script and do not move the generated socket.zip file.

Good work!
