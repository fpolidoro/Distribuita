This folder contains all the software you need to test your solution.
It contains the following items:
	\tools		---> contains software utilities that are used in the testing script (check them, if you want)
	test.sh		---> the main script you need to launch to test your solution and get your result
	README.txt	---> this file
	socket.zip	---> the file to be tested. Please provide a valid .zip file as described in the exam text
To launch the test please use one of the following commands:
./test.sh
	or
bash test.sh
The script expects the file to be named exactly "socket.zip" and to be placed in the same dir of the script (the folder in which you found this file).

Good work!
